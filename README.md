# 🚀 ITBooster Challenges

Welcome to my engineering playground.
This repository serves as a collection of isolated "learning-by-doing" projects. Each folder represents a specific challenge aimed at mastering new technologies, architectural patterns, or libraries in the modern web ecosystem.

## 🎯 Philosophy
*   **Speed:** Rapid prototyping to understand core concepts.
*   **Practice:** "Hands-on" approach over passive reading.
*   **Modernity:** focus on cutting-edge stacks (Next.js App Router, React Server Components, TanStack Query, etc.).

## 📂 Challenges Directory

| Project | Tech Stack | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| [`tanstack-learning`](./tanstack-learning) | **TanStack Query v5**, Next.js, Tailwind | Mastering Server State: caching, mutations, optimistic updates, and race condition handling. |
